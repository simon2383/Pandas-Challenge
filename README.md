# Pandas-Challenge

The task is to analyze the district-wide standardized test results of students in a city's school district. The analysis includes creating district and school-level summaries and identifying the top and bottom performing schools based on overall passing rate. The report also includes average math and reading scores by grade, scores by school spending, size, and type. The tables should include metrics such as total students, budget, passing rates, and average scores.


Final report included each of the following:

#District Summary

#Create a high level snapshot (in table form) of the district's key metrics, including:

Math Scores by Grade

#Create a table that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
Reading Scores by Grade

#Create a table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)
Scores by School Size

Repeat the above breakdown, but this time group schools based on a reasonable approximation of school size (Small, Medium, Large).
Scores by School Type

Repeat the above breakdown, but this time group schools based on school type (Charter vs. District).
